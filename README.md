![Google Tasks for Mac](./art/header.png)

Google Tasks has some pretty good mobile apps. However, there's no native Mac app yet. This application is a tiny wrapper around the Google Tasks widget that's embedded in Gmail and Google Calendar.

## Contributing

Google Tasks for Mac uses nativefier and electron under the hood to create a browser window that loads Google Tasks and injects some javascript to make it actually work.

Feel free to open issues with new ideas or open pull requests with new features.
